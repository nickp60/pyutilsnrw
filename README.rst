Nick's Python Utils
=======================
I am finding myself needing to reuse code snippets, so this package is an atempt at making things more portable
----
Currently, this is all assuming python3.5
----
I've got nothing else to put here, so I'll just list some Python gripes.
* Pandas data frames. Sucks.  Why are there different syntaxes for getting rows versus columns?
* Why cant funtions be bounded by braces? Whitespace doesn't have to be this important
* Python versioning. In R, we don't look back. We dont mess around with that pillar of salt stuff. Why should I have to consider no less than 5 releases of python? Forget 2.7. Move on. Screw the legacy code base; we are just delaying the inevidable.
* Needing environment management
*
